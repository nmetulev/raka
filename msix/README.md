# Raka CLI MSIX Installation

This package contains pre-built MSIX packages for the Raka CLI tool.

> **Note:** The MSIX packages are signed with a dev certificate. Installing via the `install.cmd` script will install the dev certificate on your machine.

## Quick Installation

1. Double-click `install.cmd`
2. When prompted, allow elevation to Administrator
3. Done!

The installer automatically detects your device architecture (x64 or ARM64) and installs the correct package.

> **Note:** When downloading scripts from the internet, Windows blocks execution until they are unblocked. The `install.cmd` script should automatically unblock downloaded files. However, if that fails, you will need to right click on each file -> click Properties -> check Unblock -> click OK.

- **raka_[version]_arm64.msix** - The MSIX package for ARM64 architecture
